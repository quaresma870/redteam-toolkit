# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. See the
[README](README.md) for current features, status, and roadmap.

### v0.5.0 — Sprint 4: Reporting
- feat: `core/history.py` — SQLite persistence keyed by `engagement_id`, so module results from
  separate `recon`/`vuln-id`/`active` CLI invocations (across an entire engagement) combine into
  one report. Migrates existing databases automatically (verified against a hand-built
  pre-migration schema, not just the happy path).
- feat: `reports/build.py` — assembles a full `EngagementReport` from the validated
  `Authorization`, the audit log integrity check, and persisted module results; persists an
  integrity snapshot back to the database so the dashboard can reconstruct an equivalent report
  later without access to the original `authorization.yml`/audit log files.
- feat: `reports/html.py` — self-contained HTML report (zero external requests, not even a CDN):
  executive summary with risk posture, scope & authorization recap, modules-run summary,
  technical findings sorted by severity.
- feat: `reports/pdf.py` — PDF export via `reportlab` (pure-Python, no headless-browser or
  Cairo/Pango system dependency) with equivalent content to the HTML report.
- feat: `core/cvss.py` — CVSS scoring rubric generalised project-wide (previously vuln-id-only);
  `vuln_id/aggregate.py` re-exports it for backward compatibility. Confirmed against a real
  pipeline run that `zone_transfer`'s HIGH-severity finding (which never sets an explicit score)
  correctly receives the rubric's 7.5 when a report is built.
- feat: `dashboard/app.py` — read-only FastAPI dashboard (`redteam-toolkit serve`), mirroring this
  portfolio's existing dashboard pattern; not authenticated by default, same caution as the others.
- feat: CLI — `--db` added to `recon`/`vuln-id`/`active` to persist results; new `report` command
  (`--format html|pdf|both`); new `serve` command.
- fix: a real, self-referential bug caught by a new test before merge — the HTML report embeds
  the full `EngagementReport` as JSON inside a `<script>` tag for potential client-side use, but
  serialised it with `json.dumps()` directly. A finding's `evidence` field can contain the exact
  payload being reported on (e.g. an XSS detection's raw `<script>` tag) — if that string contains
  the literal sequence `</script`, it breaks out of the script tag and injects raw HTML into the
  report itself. Fixed by escaping `</` to `<\\/` before embedding (valid JSON either way, since
  JSON doesn't require forward slashes to be escaped but permits it). The exact same class of bug
  was also fixed in the dashboard's findings table, which rendered finding title/target/module
  content unescaped.

### v0.4.0 — Sprint 3: Active Detection
- feat: **active-tier confirmation gate** (`Engagement.confirm_active_tier()`) — on top of
  `'active'` being in `authorization.yml`'s `allowed_categories`, every CLI session must type the
  exact engagement ID via `--confirm` before any active-tier module can run. This can't be
  scripted around with a single boolean flag the way `--yes-i-am-sure` could be. Both refusal
  paths (category absent, ID mismatch) are logged with equal visibility to a success.
- feat: `sqli_detection` — error-based SQL injection detection, bounded probes per parameter,
  stops as soon as one probe confirms — never extracts data or enumerates schema
- feat: `xss_detection` — unique-marker reflected XSS detection, no execution step (no headless
  browser, ever)
- feat: `open_redirect_detection` — Location-header inspection only, never actually follows the
  externally-supplied redirect target
- feat: `ssrf_detection` — canary/callback confirmation via a new local-only `LocalCanaryListener`
  (never an external canary service), never pivots through a confirmed SSRF to reach further
  internal infrastructure
- feat: `path_traversal_detection` — confirms via a minimal, recognisable signature (`/etc/passwd`'s
  first line) rather than exfiltrating arbitrary file contents
- feat: CLI `active` command — requires `--confirm <engagement_id>` every invocation
- feat: mock target harness extended with vulnerable/safe endpoint pairs for SQLi, path traversal,
  and SSRF (XSS/open-redirect reuse Sprint 0's existing reflect/redirect pairs); the server is now
  threaded so the SSRF-vulnerable endpoint's real server-side self-fetch doesn't deadlock against a
  single-threaded accept loop
- test: 46 tests under `tests/active/` — the gate's negative-path tests are the priority (category
  absent, ID mismatch, bypassing `confirm_active_tier()` entirely, confirmation not bypassing
  scope/window, recon/vuln-id unaffected by active confirmation state), plus every detection module
  tested against both the vulnerable and safe mock-target variant with an explicit, asserted
  request-count ceiling for each

### v0.3.0 — Sprint 2: Vulnerability Identification
- feat: `cve_correlation` — fingerprinted service versions → NVD CVE lookup, CVSS-mapped severity
- feat: `tls_analyzer` — deprecated protocol/weak cipher detection, certificate expiry and
  hostname-mismatch checks, entirely passive (no Heartbleed-style exploit probes)
- feat: `http_posture` — security headers, cookie flags, CORS misconfiguration on live targets
- feat: `default_credentials` — the highest-risk module in this sprint, built conservatively:
  a small curated list (not a wordlist), exactly one attempt per pair, a stricter rate limit than
  every other module, and **mandatory explicit opt-in even when `vuln-id` is an authorized
  category** — being in scope for the category is not the same as opting into this specific check.
  No protocol-specific login client ships by default; `try_login_fn` is the extension point.
- feat: `aggregate.ensure_cvss_score()` — every finding gets a CVSS score, either from a real CVE
  record or the documented internal rubric (`docs/cvss-rubric.md`)
- feat: CLI `vuln-id` command — `default_credentials` is excluded from the default module
  selection even when explicitly named via `--modules` unless `--check-default-creds` is also passed
- fix: `TLSAnalyzerModule`'s certificate inspection initially used `ssl.getpeercert()`, which
  returns an **empty dict** whenever `verify_mode=CERT_NONE` (necessary here, since the whole
  point is to inspect untrusted/self-signed certificates without rejecting them first) — meaning
  certificate expiry and hostname checks silently never fired against any real target. Caught by
  an end-to-end test against a real generated self-signed certificate, not just injected data.
  Fixed by parsing the certificate's DER bytes directly via `cryptography` (now a runtime
  dependency, not just a test dependency) instead of relying on the stdlib's parsed-dict
  representation.
- dep: added `dnspython` (Sprint 1) and `cryptography` (this sprint) as runtime dependencies

### v0.2.0 — Sprint 1: Recon
- feat: `port_scanner` — TCP connect scan, rate-limited by default (50/sec safe, 200/sec with `--aggressive`)
- feat: `fingerprint` — banner-grab service/version identification (OpenSSH, nginx, Apache, ProFTPD, vsFTPd, Postfix)
- feat: `passive_dns` — subdomain discovery via certificate transparency logs, zero contact with the target
- feat: `active_dns` — wordlist subdomain brute force (rate-limited) + `zone_transfer` AXFR misconfiguration check
- feat: `web_fingerprint` — Server/X-Powered-By headers, lightweight CMS signature detection
- feat: `endpoint_discovery` — robots.txt/sitemap.xml parsed directly, then a curated wordlist probe with path categorisation
- feat: CLI `recon` command ties all modules together against one target, through the scope gate
- fix: `web_fingerprint`/`endpoint_discovery` accept a target that may include a scheme/port (since they need
  a full URL to make an HTTP request) — but were passing that full URL straight to the scope gate, which
  only ever matches bare hosts/IPs/domains per `authorization.yml`'s schema. A URL-style target was therefore
  *always* refused even when the bare host was correctly in scope. Fixed with a shared `extract_host()`
  helper used before every `authorize_action()` call in both modules; the original target string is still
  used for the actual HTTP request. Caught during manual end-to-end validation before any test existed —
  locked in with regression tests in both modules' test files.

### v0.1.0 — Sprint 0: Foundation & Safety
- feat: `authorization.yml` schema + validator (CIDR/wildcard scope matching, time window)
- feat: tamper-evident, hash-chained audit log
- feat: `Engagement` — the structural scope-enforcement gate every module will call through
- feat: `Finding`/`ModuleResult`/`EngagementReport` data models
- feat: CLI — `init`, `validate-scope`, `status`
- feat: local-only mock-target test harness for CI (no real network calls, ever)
